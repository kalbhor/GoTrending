# GoTrending

### GoTrending is a [GitHub bot](https://github.com/GoTrending) that stars trending Go repositories.


#### *Why though?*

- Follow it and it'll provide you with trending repos directly on your feed.
- Acts as a simple store for trending repositories.
- I was bored and I wanted to build something.
